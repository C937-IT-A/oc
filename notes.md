windowed execution will generate a toolbar
    at the top containing the program name
    and copyright information much like
    Microsoft Windows' toolbar. this program
    will also generate a sidebar on the left
    that houses program-specific actions

settings scan dimension files should contain only one number and nothing but one number

requires non-monochrome graphics & screen

works best at high resolution

when finished remove whitespace for omptimization as readability is no longer an issue

this will not fully work for an area larger than the screen resolution; ability to view differences dependent. may need to run multiple computers with this program to cover a very large area
